    <name>Edit Plist file</name>
    
    <description>
        A cordova "plugin" that helps you indicate the modifications on the iOS's *-info.plist file.
        So it avoids you to directly edit the *-info.plist file.
        For example it is used to whitelist some schemes for ios9.
        This plugin was initially created to avoid iOS 9 problems that prevent opening other apps from your own app because some used plugins aren't updated to take into consideration the new specification for iOS 9.
